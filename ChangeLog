2019-02-15  Justin Collier  <jpcxist@gmail.com>

	* src/templimiter/daemon/monitor.cc
	(is_below_max_speed_, is_above_min_speed_): 
	Changed min/max criteria to use the midpoint between two steps in order
	minimize false positives due to fluctuations.
	(dethrottle_next_higher_, throttle_next_lower_)
	(dethrottle_highest_, throttle_lowest_)
	(exec_dethrottle_, exec_throttle_, run, Monitor):
	Added expected frequency checking based on previously set values.

	* src/templimiter/daemon/monitor.h
	(Monitor): Created variables that track unexpected throttle behavior in order 
	to minimize overthrottling when the scaling_max_freq files are being modified 
	externally.
	(dethrottle_highest_, throttle_lowest_): New arg cur_speeds.
	Provided cur_speeds externally in response to new expected frequency checking
	(some cores may be linked in the system).

	* src/templimiter/tools/vector.h
	(max_n_elements): Created procedure.
	(min_n_elements): Created procedure.

	* README.md: Clarified prerequisites and installation instructions.
